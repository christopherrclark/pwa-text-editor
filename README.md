# PWA Text Editor

## Project Summary

The goal of this assignment was to create a PWA text editor application with the existing code we were given, that runs in the browser and has been deployed to Heroku. The app is a single page application that meets the PWA requirements. The application features a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. The application also functions offline.
